In the\nmeanwhile, Skywalker ended the negotiations with [Razian](/wiki/Razian\n\"Razian\"), an alien that should have provided the supplies to the Rebel\nAlliance, but noticed that half the credits were missing. He understood that\nSolo took part to the race, and went to the stadium in which Solo was racing.\nIn the stands he heard two criminals talking about how they would knock Solo\nout: Skywalker and Chewbacca put the two criminals out of action, and\nSkywalker went to help Solo who was being targeted by his opponents who agreed\nto eliminate him. Solo, helped by his friend, was able to win the race, and\nthey could eventually pay Razian for the supplies.[53]\n\n#### The _Desert Jewel_\n\n    \" _Ever since the Battle of Yavin, I feel sometimes that people expect me to top it and wonder why I haven't yet._ \"\n    \u2015Luke Skywalker[51]\n\n[![Luke defends\nDrusil](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/3/38/Luke_defends_Drusil.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150918002940)\n[![Luke defends\nDrusil](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/3/38/Luke_defends_Drusil.jpg/revision/latest/scale-\nto-width-\ndown/215?cb=20150918002940)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/3/38/Luke_defends_Drusil.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150918002940)\n[](/wiki/File:Luke_defends_Drusil.jpg)\n\nSkywalker defending Drusil Bephorin on Denon.\n\nIn an errand for Admiral [Gial Ackbar](/wiki/Gial_Ackbar \"Gial Ackbar\"),\nSkywalker was dispatched to", "start_char_idx": 119212, "end_char_idx": 121003, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47cb3ff8-da33-4a50-9600-7cb86a248583": {"__data__": {"id_": "47cb3ff8-da33-4a50-9600-7cb86a248583", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6a51ec452840bc300bc6fe0fd21329b49a03408bdd2995a8508c4b0f106413c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "00af34be-04b5-43ce-a8f1-0910889a3cf8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "daef0b499af7dcd6d6ed74e8869ebc6c36734963a476430b0678643f9430ff7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9468a0f2-e4fd-40aa-9af5-d7e3236a6b12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ef598e57e3934d8ddc3008d37490ba699fc4dd8799050a1534cb44bd91007f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "defending Drusil Bephorin on Denon.\n\nIn an errand for Admiral [Gial Ackbar](/wiki/Gial_Ackbar \"Gial Ackbar\"),\nSkywalker was dispatched to the planet [Rodia](/wiki/Rodia \"Rodia\") in order\nto open a secret weapon supply line for the Alliance.

This moment\nmade Skywalker realize that Rey's level of power was identical to that of his\nnephew Ben; this caused him to worry whether he should train another with such\npower and to promptly abandon the lesson.[17] But Skywalker did not just see\nBen in her, he also saw much of himself, which he suspected was what scared\nhim most.[241] Skywalker realized something else from this lesson; that Rey\nwas the Emperor, Darth Sidious', granddaughter, which is why she was so easily\ndrawn to the dark side.[195] He later found her practicing with a\n[quarterstaff](/wiki/Quarterstaff \"Quarterstaff\") and then with the returned\nlightsaber. Luke silently watched from afar, his concern and dismay increasing\nwhen he witnessed her ferocity with the weapon allowing her to slice through\nseveral rock formations apart with ease.[17] He recognized that she was\nfocused and talented, but also that she was impetuous and driven by emotion,\nenmity, and impatience, which he knew lead to the dark side and found all too\nfamiliar. After she cut down a large rock, as he had anticipated she would, he\ntold her it was time for the second lesson.[242]\n\nEventually, after the second lesson, Skywalker sat and spoke with Rey, telling\nher that the true legacy of the Jedi was failure, and revealing that they were\nresponsible for the creation of Darth Vader. Rey pointed out that he had seen\nthe light in Vader and turned him,[17] but Skywalker just wished that he had\nnever told that story and thus not allowed it or himself to become a\nlegend.[242] He then revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous\npower in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark\nside, becoming Kylo Ren. He then destroyed the Jedi temple Skywalker had\nstarted, taking some of his other apprentices with him and killing the rest.\nRey ended the conversation by telling him that the galaxy needed a legend,\nassuring him that he had not failed Ben and she would not fail him.[17] That\nnight, Rey having reminded him that his solitude had cost him his connections\nto those he loved and not just his connection", "start_char_idx": 545555, "end_char_idx": 547845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f48a0da-3277-4d0a-9632-99a4644e4733": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f48a0da-3277-4d0a-9632-99a4644e4733", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6a51ec452840bc300bc6fe0fd21329b49a03408bdd2995a8508c4b0f106413c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f198197-a74a-49c6-9ae2-4757cc051c99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d52cce999d23e1a66a40ad493ffd02e20af2b3b7a212194aa82030d6cebea68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "278549ec-4350-4d35-a954-b8b2177bed19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b58ee63877b5b7e943a82532b43af872115fa7a46236b171063bfce658bad675", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "to become a\nlegend.[242] He then revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous\npower in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark\nside, becoming Kylo Ren.

as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself\nto the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the\nintention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi.[17] Despite\nall of this, he still comforted Chewbacca when he learned of Han Solo's death,\nand became even more riddled with guilt.[238] He also became more cautious in\nteaching others of immense power due to Solo's betrayal, feeling finished with\nthe Jedi Order,[252] as evidenced by when he initially regarded Rey as a\ndelusional child,[238] initially refused to train her, and when he would later\ndecide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her drawn towards the dark\nside.[17] Part of this was because he was deeply terrified by how much she\nreminded him of himself.[241] He also

had abandoned those he loved in selfish pity, which he was\ndetermined to rectify.[242]\n\nHowever, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope,\nSkywalker finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance.\nDespite his lost faith in his nephew, Skywalker showed great remorse for\nfailing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the\nturning point in Solo's fall.[17] Skywalker realized that instead of blaming\nhimself, he blamed the Jedi for his failures.

When consumed by anger and fear over what he had learned and\nlost, he lashed out with the Force, hurtling a squadron of Tie Fighters into\neach other. In another outburst, he accidentally cracked the window of a\nstarship while desperately trying and failing to contact Yoda.[140] However,\nhe regained his connection when he tried to reach out for his lightsaber and\nhad a vision of Verla and that Organa was in trouble.
